In addition, newer dining options, including Chef Mike’s Sub Shop and Faculty House, have yet to be integrated into the University’s current composting program.

According to Columbia Dining, all waste collected from the bins in JJ’s and Ferris is sent to a compost facility. These two dining halls, however, do not have dish rooms and instead provide compostable napkins and food vessels—like plates and bowls— to students.

In addition, 48.7 percent of students indicated they dispose of compostable items provided by dining halls into trash bins—suggesting almost half of compostable vessels provided by Columbia Dining may be sent directly to landfill after use. Furthermore, 15.6 percent indicated they place compostable items in the “Mixed paper” bin and 4.8 percent into the “Metal, plastic, and glass” bin, thereby contaminating recyclable waste."

When asked about their comfort deciphering what is and is not recyclable on a scale from one to 10, the average comfort level came out to 6.8. Despite students’ overall confidence, the range of responses—combined with documented incidences of missorting—indicates that further education on sorting waste may be useful.

While Columbia has made significant strides in its sustainability efforts regarding waste, including sending 95 percent of waste generated from academic buildings to a waste-to-energy plant, the Sustainable Columbia website admits to a “relatively stagnant diversion rate.” To achieve waste diversion or avoid sending reusable materials to landfill, waste should be properly sorted."

Still, our individual actions add up. We can do our part by educating ourselves on what is and is not <a href=\"https://sustainable.columbia.edu/content/compost\">compostable</a> and by becoming familiar with <a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dsny/site/services/recycling/what-to-recycle\">New York City’s recycling rules</a>, so that we can properly sort waste and less reusable waste ends up in landfills. We can also accumulate compostables and participate in the GrowNYC program, which collects food scraps at the Greenmarket on Broadway on Thursdays and Sundays. Another alternative includes utilizing Barnard’s yellow “organics” bins—located in Barnard Hall, Milbank Hall, Altschul Hall, and the Diana Center—to dispose of food scraps, although I have noticed these are often missing. My suite keeps a compost bin in our kitchen to make proper food waste disposal more convenient. These actions, however, do not resolve the issue of disposing of compostable vessels around campus—neither program accepts them."

When far from Ferris or JJ’s, I don’t know where to dispose of compostable vessels, other than the trash bin right by me. Yet, I can’t help but wince everytime I see piled-up compostable vessels and food scraps overflowing in campus trash bins. When we stand in front of a waste station, be it in Ferris or on the South Lawn, we should know exactly where our waste should go and be confident that it will get there. While we must do our part, ultimately, it will take a combination of student action and renewed administrative efforts to expand Columbia’s composting program and eliminate the waste contamination currently hindering meaningful waste diversion initiatives."
